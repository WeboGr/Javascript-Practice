1.	Collatz Conjecture (3n+1):
		The Collatz conjecture (also known as 3n+1 conjecture) is a conjecture that applying the following algorithm to any number we will always eventually reach one:

	  [This is writen in pseudocode]
	  if(number is even) number = number / 2
	  if(number is odd) number = 3*number + 1
	  
	  Task : Your task is to make a function hotpo that takes a positive n as input and returns the number of times you need to perform this      algorithm to get n = 1.
	  
	  Example : 
	  hotpo(1) returns 0
	  (1 is already 1)
	  
	  hotpo(5) returns 5
	  5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
	  
	  hotpo(6) returns 8
	  6 -> 3 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
